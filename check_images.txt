Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg as a "labrador retriever." However, this classification was incorrect in terms of breed as the real label was simply "dog" without specifying a breed. 

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  Yes, each model classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "labrador retriever." Thus, all three architectures consistently classified these two images as the same breed.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg (which was a cat) and Object_Name_01.jpg (labeled as "human") as non-dog images. There were no misclassifications in terms of identifying them as not being dogs, achieving 100% accuracy in this aspect.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: 
All three model architectures (ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG) performed similarly on this dataset, each achieving:
100% accuracy in identifying dog vs. non-dog images.
0% accuracy in correctly classifying the breed of the dogs (mislabeling both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "labrador retriever" when the correct breed label wasnâ€™t provided).
Given the identical performance across these metrics, none of the models clearly outperformed the others on this specific task. If a choice must be made, we could select the architecture with the lowest runtime for efficiency, which is AlexNet with an elapsed runtime of 0:0:0. This makes AlexNet the most time-efficient choice while maintaining the same classification results as the others.
